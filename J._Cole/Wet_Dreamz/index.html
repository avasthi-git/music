Cole
<br>
Cole, world, yeah
<br>
Let me take y'all back man
<br>
As I do so well
<br>
Wasn't nothin' like that
<br>
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first, time
<br>
She was in my math class
<br>
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
<br>
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
<br>
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
<br>
It started off so innocent
<br>
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
<br>
I was a youngin' straight crushin' tryna play this shit cool
<br>
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
<br>
'Cause when I seen 'em thighs on her
<br>
And them hips on her and them lips on her
<br>
Got me daydreaming, man what
<br>
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it
<br>
If she licks on it
<br>
Make it hard for me to stand up
<br>
As time goes by, attractions gettin' deep and
<br>
Wet dreamin' thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'
<br>
I want it bad
<br>
And I ain't never been obsessed before
<br>
She wrote a note that said
<br>
You ever had sex before?
<br>
Damn
<br>
And I ain't never did this before, no
<br>
And I ain't never did this before, no
<br>
And I ain't never did this before, no
<br>
And I ain't never did this before, no
<br>
And I ain't never did this before, no
<br>
I ain't never did this before, no
<br>
And I ain't never did this before, no
<br>
And I ain't never did this before, no
<br>
I wrote back and said
<br>
Of course I had sex before, knowing I was frontin'
<br>
I said, I'm like a pro, baby, knowing I was stuntin'
<br>
But if I told the truth I knew I'd get played out, son
<br>
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
<br>
But, she don't know that
<br>
So she done wrote back and told me
<br>
Oh you a pro homie? Well I want you to show me
<br>
My mama gone for the weekend
<br>
So Saturday baby we can get to freakin'
<br>
That's when my heart start racing
<br>
And my body start sweatin'
<br>
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
<br>
I'm thinking how that body look naked
<br>
When you layin' on the bed
<br>
Teacher, please don't make me stand up
<br>
I wrote back like, yeah, baby, sound like a plan
<br>
Still trying to play it cool, sound like the man
<br>
But I was scared to death my nigga
<br>
My stomach turned
<br>
Talking shit knowing, damn well I was a virgin
<br>
Fuck
<br>
And I ain't never did this before, no
<br>
And I ain't never did this before, no
<br>
And I ain't never did this before, no
<br>
And I ain't never did this before, no
<br>
And I ain't never did this before, no
<br>
I ain't never did this before, no
<br>
And I ain't never did this before, no
<br>
And I ain't never did this before, no
<br>
You know that feeling when you know
<br>
You finna bone for the first time
<br>
I'm hoping that she won't notice it's my first time
<br>
I'm hoping that my shit is big enough to fuck with
<br>
And most of all I'm praying
<br>
God don't let me bust quick
<br>
I'm watching pornos trying to see
<br>
Just how to stroke right
<br>
Practice putting condoms on, how it go right
<br>
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'
<br>
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
<br>
That's when my hands start touchin'
<br>
And her face start blushin'
<br>
And a nigga roll over on top
<br>
And then she get my pants unbuckled
<br>
And her hands start rubbing on me
<br>
Ooh girl don't stop
<br>
It's time for action
<br>
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah
<br>
Just how I practiced
<br>
But right before I put it in
<br>
She flinched and grabbed it and said
<br>
I wanna get something off my mental
<br>
I can tell you're a pro, but baby be gentle, 'cause
<br>
'Cause I ain't never did this before, no
<br>
And I ain't never did this before, no
<br>
And I ain't never did this before, no
<br>
And I ain't never did this before, no
<br>
And I ain't never did this before, no
<br>
I ain't never did this before, no
<br>
And I ain't never did this before, no
<br>
And I ain't never did this before, no
